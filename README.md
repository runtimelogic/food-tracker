This is my version of the code resulting from working through the iOS Swift / UIKit tutorial project.
Some variable naming and code structure was done differently to experiment with Swift nomenclature and see how well it works with the class varible / method naming style I have used in the past, as well as to play around with the refactoring feature set of XCode.
